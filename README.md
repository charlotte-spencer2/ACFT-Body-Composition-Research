Gender Differences and Associations to the ACFT

In October of 2020, the US Army began utilizing a new standardized test to assess physical fitness readiness. 
The ACFT uses a gender neautral scale, and assesses soldiers physical readiness through 6 exercises. Each exercise is designed to target specific warrior tasks and drills and combat symmetric movements that are graded on a scale of 0 - 100. This leaves soldiers the opportunity to earn a perfect score of 600. 
Soldiers are graded on a gender neutral scale, which is a major change from the previous physical fitness test, the APFT, which had different exercises and differing benchmarks for men and women. 

This element of the new test has been cause for controversy in the US Army, as many woemn failed to reach even the minimum standards in most of the events. As a result, the US Army has haulted using the reults of this test to make any administrative decisions until further analysis of the implicatiosn of this new test are explored.

The goal of this project is to collect anthropomorphic and body composition measurements of soldiers, so to identify any potential differences that may exist between men and woman and their performance on ACFt events. Anthropomorphic measurements are collected using a 3D body imaging system  called the Styku Body Scanner. The sample being analyzed in this project comes from cadets at the United States Military Academy.
